# Portfolio Site

1. For Frontend, I have used React and GatsbyJs.
2. For Backend, I have used strapi.

## Setup Notes

1. Install all packages using (npm install)
2. For backend, Go for StrapiJs and read it carefully about it. You can also use my backend.

3. For contact form, I have used formspree. Go to the formspree website and setup a contact for your website also and integrate it with application endpoints.
